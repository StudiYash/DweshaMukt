# YouTube Test Inputs ðŸŽ¥

This folder provides instructions for testing **YouTube Live Comments** using the DweshaMukt project.

## Instructions to Obtain YouTube Video ID
1. Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).
2. Find a live-streaming video or a recent video with active comments.
3. Click on the video to open it. The **Video ID** is the part of the URL after `v=`. For example, in the URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEFGHIJK`, the Video ID is `ABCDEFGHIJK`.

## Testing Procedure
- Copy the Video ID of the selected YouTube video.
- Input this Video ID into the DweshaMukt project to fetch live comments.
- Run the project to classify the comments as hate or non-hate speech in real-time.

> *Tip: Choose videos with active comments to see how the project performs with real-time text analysis.*
