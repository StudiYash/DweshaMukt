# GIF Test Inputs 🎞️

This folder contains sample **GIF Files** that you can use to test the DweshaMukt project's hate speech detection capabilities.

## Instructions
- Select a GIF file from this folder.
- Upload the GIF as input to the DweshaMukt project.
- Run the project to see if it accurately extracts and classifies any text present in the GIF frames as hate or non-hate speech.

> *Tip: Try using GIFs with different text and frames to observe how the project handles animated content.*
