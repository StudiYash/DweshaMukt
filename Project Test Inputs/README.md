# Project Test Inputs ðŸ“‚

Welcome to the **Project Test Inputs** folder! This folder contains various sample files organized by input type, allowing you to test the capabilities of the **DweshaMukt** project. These trial inputs are provided to help you quickly evaluate the project's functionality across different media formats.

DweshaMukt supports the classification of **text, audio, images, GIFs, video, and YouTube comments**. Each of these media types can be analyzed using our model for hate speech detection. Below, you'll find an overview of each supported input type, along with convenient links to access the sample files.

## Supported Input Types

The following input types are supported by the DweshaMukt project:

- **Text**: Raw text files containing various sentences available for analysis.
- **Audio**: Audio files that are transcribed and then analyzed for hate speech.
- **Image**: Image files from which text is extracted and then classified.
- **GIF**: GIF files where text is extracted from each frame and analyzed.
- **Video**: Video files, where audio and text content is extracted and classified.
- **YouTube Comments**: A live feed of YouTube comments, fetched for real-time analysis.

Each input type has been rigorously tested to ensure compatibility and accuracy in classification. The provided test files are a great starting point for exploring the projectâ€™s capabilities.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Project**: Ensure you have the DweshaMukt project downloaded and set up on your local system.
2. **Select a Test Input**: Choose a sample file from the appropriate folder above based on the input type you want to test.
3. **Run the Classification**: Use the DweshaMukt Frontend Interface or DweshaMukt Telegram Bots to upload the selected file and observe the output.
4. **Analyze Results**: Review the classification output to understand the projectâ€™s hate speech detection capabilities.

Feel free to experiment with these files to see how DweshaMukt handles various media types. These inputs are designed to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the model in detecting hate speech across different formats.
