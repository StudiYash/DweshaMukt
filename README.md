## 1. Project Introduction

### Abstract
Hate speech poses a significant threat to societal harmony and safety, often inciting violence and discrimination. Recent real-time incidents, such as communal unrest in various parts of the world triggered by inflammatory online content, highlight the need for effective hate speech detection mechanisms. DweshaMukt is an **Advanced Multilingual and Multimodal Hate Speech Detection System** that leverages the **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** algorithm, along with advanced **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

This project specifically addresses the challenges of detecting hate speech within the **Hinglish** language, a code-mixed variant combining Hindi and English along with the **Hindi** as well as **English** languages. Utilizing a pre-trained BERT model, we tailored it for real-time scenarios, providing robust and in-depth analysis capabilities. The system adopts a **multilingual and multimodal approach**, enabling the detection of hate speech across various content formats, including **text**, **audio**, **video**, **images**, **GIFs**, and **YouTube Video Comments**.

Experimental results show an accuracy of **88%**, underscoring the model's efficacy in hate speech detection and its potential for application in diverse real-world contexts.
