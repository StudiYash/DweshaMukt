## Project Introduction 🛡️

### Abstract 
In today’s digital landscape, hate speech is an escalating concern, often fueling division and unrest across communities. DweshaMukt is an **Advanced Multilingual and Multimodal Hate Speech Detection System** designed to counteract this issue by harnessing the power of **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** alongside cutting-edge **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

Our system tackles a unique challenge: detecting hate speech within **Hinglish**—a dynamic blend of Hindi and English—while also supporting **Hindi** and **English** languages individually. DweshaMukt leverages a pre-trained BERT model, specially optimized for real-time scenarios, offering robust analysis across a range of media. Its **Multilingual and Multimodal architecture** enables Hate Speech Detection across diverse content types: **Text**, **Audios**, **Images**, **Videos**, **GIFs**, and **YouTube Comments**.

With an accuracy of **88%**, DweshaMukt stands as a promising solution for real-world hate speech detection applications, bridging language and media barriers to ensure safer, more inclusive online spaces.

## Project Backend 🖥️

The backend architecture of DweshaMukt enables the system to classify various forms of input **text, audio, video, images, GIFs, and live YouTube comments** by first converting each to text before applying the hate speech detection model. Here are the main scenarios handled by the system:

1. **Text Input**: Processes user-entered text directly.
2. **Audio Input**: Converts audio to text using `Google Speech to Text API`, then classifies it.
3. **Image Input**: Extracts text from images via `Google Cloud Vision API`.
4. **GIF Input**: Analyzes GIFs using `Google Video Intelligence API` for text extraction.
5. **Video Input**: Extracts audio from videos, transcribes it, and classifies it.
6. **Live YouTube Video**: Fetches live comments using `pytchat` library, then classifies them.

The combined code integrates all these scenarios into a unified detection system, including added emoticon-based classification for enhanced accuracy.
