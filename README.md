## 1. Project Introduction üõ°Ô∏è

### Abstract üìÑ
In today‚Äôs digital landscape, hate speech is an escalating concern, often fueling division and unrest across communities. DweshaMukt is an **Advanced Multilingual and Multimodal Hate Speech Detection System** designed to counteract this issue by harnessing the power of **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** alongside cutting-edge **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

Our system tackles a unique challenge: detecting hate speech within **Hinglish**‚Äîa dynamic blend of Hindi and English‚Äîwhile also supporting **Hindi** and **English** languages individually. DweshaMukt leverages a pre-trained BERT model, specially optimized for real-time scenarios, offering robust analysis across a range of media. Its **multilingual and multimodal architecture** enables hate speech detection across diverse content types: **text**, **audio**, **video**, **images**, **GIFs**, and **YouTube comments**.

With an accuracy of **88%**, DweshaMukt stands as a promising solution for real-world hate speech detection applications, bridging language and media barriers to ensure safer, more inclusive online spaces.

**Index Terms:** Hate Speech Detection, BERT, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Multilingual, Multimodal, Hinglish, Real-Time Analysis

## 2. Backend Preparation üîß

### Mark Models Index

The backend development was an intricate journey, involving months of rigorous research, experimentation, and iterative coding. Each phase contributed to refining the system‚Äôs ability to detect hate speech across various input types and languages. 

Our **Mark Model Index Document** provides a comprehensive overview of this journey, showcasing each model‚Äôs evolution, from early concepts to the final optimized versions. Dive into the document to see how each model was crafted, tested, and fine-tuned to tackle the challenges of multilingual, multimodal hate speech detection.
